**Irrigation Identification and Prediction** 

My work on this topic combines geopatial analysis, computer vision, and deep learning to locate irrigated cropland in East Africa. I use a combination of LANDSAT satellite imagery, cropland layers, and USDA agricultural censuses to determine the phenology of irrigated land in the US; with these learned spatio-temporal patterns, I apply a domain-transfer approach to regions of the world where information on the location of irrigation is unavailable. As electricity demand for productive uses -- for irrigation, other agricultural applications, and commercial and industrial applications -- is likely to drive load growth in East Africa, understanding the likely scale and distribution of this consumption provides valuable information to system planners.

**Electricity Network Analysis and Design**

Building on previous analyses set in New York State, I am also working on optimization models of an interconnected grid system in the Eastern US. Prior work has shown that combining electrification of heating and transportation with renewable energy expanstion is the best approach to reducing energy-related emisisions; by simulating these coupled energy transitions in larger system that offers increased grid flexibility, I aim to find cost-effective pathways for integrating renewable generation and meeting decarbonization goals.
