**Irrigation Identification and Prediction** 

My work on irrigation identification and prediction combines geopatial analysis, computer vision, and deep learning to locate irrigated cropland in East Africa. I use a combination of LANDSAT satellite imagery and USDA NASS cropland layers and agricultural censuses to determine the phenology of known irrigated land in the US; with these learned spatio-temporal patterns, I apply a domain-transfer approach to regions of the world where information on the location of irrigation is unavailable. As electricity demand for productive uses -- for irrigation, other agricultural applications, and commercial and industrial applications -- is likely to drive load growth in East Africa, understanding the likely scale and distribution of this consumption provides valuable information to system planners.

**Electricity Network Analysis and Design**

Building on previous analyses set in New York State, I am also part of a team working on simulations of an interconnected grid system in the Eastern US in order to determine optimal pathways for integrating renewable generation. Prior work has shown that coupling electrification of heating and transportation with renewable energy expanstion is the best approach to reducing energy-related emisisions; by simulating these energy  transitions in larger system that offers increased grid flexibility, we aim to find cost-effective methods of decarbonization that can inform policy decisions.
