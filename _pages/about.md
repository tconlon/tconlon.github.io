I'm a 4th year PhD Student in the Sustainable Engineering Lab at Columbia University. My research focuses on the effects of electricity demand on energy system design in a variety of settings, including New York State, the Eastern US, and East Africa. I use a combination of methods to best understand the engineering implications of energy systems in transition: For projects set in Ethiopia and Kenya, I use geospatial analysis, computer vision, and deep learning strategies to identify the location of irrigated cropland and attendant energy requirements; I have also developed Generative Adversarial Networks to identify landscape differences that correlate to varied levels of electricity consumption. For work based in the US, I build optimization models to characterize regional grid systems in order to evaluate cost-effective strategies for integrating renewable generation and achieving climate goals.
