I am a 4th year PhD Student in the Sustainable Engineering Lab at Columbia University. My research focuses on the effects of electricity demand on energy system design in a variety of settings, including New York State, the Eastern US, and East Africa. I use a combination of different methods and strategies to best understand the engineering implications of elecrticity in transition: For projects set in Ethiopia and Kenya, I have used geospatial analysis, computer vision, and machine learning strategies to identify the location of irrigated cropland and attendant energy requirements; for work based in the US, I have built optimization models to characterize regional grid systems in order to evaluate cost-effective mthods of integrating renewable generation and achieving recent climate goals.
