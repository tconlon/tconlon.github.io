[Checkout a recent project](https://medium.com/@tconlon10/visualizing-residential-electricity-consumption-with-satellite-imagery-and-gans-b0bbb0fa39d6) that uses GANs and high-resolution satellite imagery to visualize features predictive of residential electricity consumption. This work was done in collaboration with Simone Fobi.
